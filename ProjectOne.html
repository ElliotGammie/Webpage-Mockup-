              Scats Operator (Auckland Transport)

              <p class="scats_paragraph">
              With this role we also optimise key routes and apply changes where necessary for further optimisation to improve the journeys of thousands of individuals in the Auckland region.
              The system is deep and can be adapted to suit changes in traffic patterns so we are trained to be adaptable and forward thinking.
              Using multiple systems to read traffic patterns and analyse the past traffic flows using graphs and other models allows us to implement plans that replicate or improve multiple intersections when faults arise.

              I also was trained in Information technology solutions and was on a team that was focused on development of these three software’s.
              I was focused on testing and the point of call for fault repair with the managers and supervisors.

            Udacity Front-End development program is aimed at people who have a varied range of experience with programming.
            This Course aims at teaching front-end web design, javascript and core fundamentals that will be nessecary to get into the profession.'
            The projects include a portfolio webpage like this one, a memory game, a restaraunt reviews app, and a classic arcade game.
            <br></br>
            This course is one of the first I intend to do, I am looking at the IOS developer course as my next course.
            After working in the transportation industry I would like to design and help build applications that benefit this area.
            I am open to new industries however and that is why I am doing this course. The udacity platform also has a lot of free courses.
            I have had a look at the self-driving car free course which is great.
            I would recommend anyone who is interested in programming to check these out, they provide video tutorials and quizes that test what you learn.

               I have been snowboarding for about a year. I have been to Mount Ruapehu which is in New Zealand.
               I taught myself snowboarding and want to travel with my partner to switzerland to enjoy the snow there.

             <p class="gaming_paragraph">
               I was bought up with video games and they have stayed with me into my adult years. They can teach you lots of problem solving skills.
               Also there are games that can teach you history, and they are also a good source to understand programming.
               Games are built on rules just like programming and developing. Systems must be created and bugs must be erased so it functions correctly.
               In the Udacity course there will be some projects that focus on classic arcade games.
